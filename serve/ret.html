<h1>The revenue equivalence theorem</h1>
<p>This semester I took a class called Market Design. It's an economics class that
focuses on different rules for markets and their outcomes under equilibrium. 
One of the more interesting things I learned was something called the revenue 
equivalence theorem. It states the following: any mechanism that results in the
same outcomes also has the same expected revenue (there are certain other
conditions but they are pretty much always met). For example, let's say that we
want to auction an item and we have two different ways of creating the auction:
One is a first price auction, meaning that the highest bidder wins and pays his
bid. The other one is a second price auction, meaning the highest bidder wins
and pays the amount of the second highest bid. In both of these cases we can
expect the amount paid to be the same! But how? It seems like the second price
auction would result in a lower amount being paid since the winner is paying the
second highest bid, whereas in the first price auction the winner pays his own
bid: the highest bid. This is actually because the optimal bidding strategies
differ for the first and second price auction.</p>
<h2>Bidding strategies</h2>
<p>Thankfully, to prove that the bidding strategies for both of these auctions
differ is not too hard, especially if you have some prior knowledge. Let's say
that we have two agents in our auction: 1 and 2 with valuations $v_1$ and $v_2$
such that $v_1 &gt; v_2$.</p>
<h3>Strategy for second price auction</h3>
<p>Let's say that as $v_2$ you choose to bid $b &gt; v_2$. If $b &lt; v_1$ you still
don't win the auction, the outcome is the same. If you bid $b &gt; v_1 &gt; v_2$, you
win the auction and get the item, but at a price $v_1$ which is greater than
your valuation of the item. Now what if you bid $b &lt; v_2$, in this case the
outcome is the same, you don't win the item (while at the same time decreasing
your chances of getting it for a price you would have paid). Therefore in a
second price auction the optimal strategy is to simply bid your valuation of the
item.</p>
<h3>Strategy for first price auction</h3>
<p>For a first price auction I will simply prove that bidding your true valuation
is not the optimal strategy. Lets say that $v_1 &gt;&gt; v_2$. And we have the
following bids $(b_1, b_2) = (v_1, v_2)$. As $b_1$ you are going to win the
auction, but you are incentivized to decrease your bid since you could still win
the auction with bid $v_2 + \epsilon$, therefore $(b_1, b_2) = (v_1, v_2)$ is
not a Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>As you can see the strategies for these different types of auctions differ, in
fact in the first price auction you are incentivized to bid lower than your true
valuation and for this reason the expected revenue is the same. The proof for
this is a little longer so I won't go through it but this gives a solid
intuition.</p>
