_Some events have been intentionally omitted. Timestamps may not be totally accurate._

## Day 1
### 0930
I arrive at Keflavik International Airport after taking a red-eye flight in which I did not sleep. It's technically 5:30 a.m. for me, but I'm not tired.

### 1000
I step out of the airport; the air is cold and fresh. The sun is extremely bright. The airport is pretty far away from Reykjavik, so I take a bus into town — it's $50.

### 1100
I arrive in town and take a secondary bus that drops me close to my hotel. I walk there and check in on a large screen. My capsule is nice, modern, and cozy. It was the cheapest hotel I could find in Reykjavik.

### 1200
I go explore the city. I eat breakfast at a nice café — the food was mid, the coffee was better. All the tourists I see are quadragenarians or above. This may have been a mistake.

### 1300
I take an electric scooter to see the Sun Voyager, Hallgrímskirkja, and the Harpa Concert Hall. The architecture is intriguing. The wind is powerful. I send it down a hill on the scooter.

### 1400
Armed with my swimsuit and backpack, I decide to scooter to Sky Lagoon to partake in Icelandic bathing culture. It's on the outskirts of Reykjavik, so it takes me 40 minutes to get there. I stop to take pictures of beautiful sights on the way. One of them is a statue of a little boy carrying a fish — the background is picturesque.

### 1500
I change in the locker room, take a shower, and hop in the warm lagoon water. The contrasting temperatures of the air and water make for an interesting experience. I head to the poolside bar.

### 1700
I've had the maximum number of beers they're allowed to serve you while in the lagoon: three. As I walk out, a British girl tries to flirt with me by pretending to confuse me with her friend. I tell her I'm Mexican. As I walk out, I dip my feet in the cold plunge. It's far too cold. I decide to skip it. As I walk into the sauna, it's far too hot. I walk back to the cold plunge and get in. I'm shaking. I return to the sauna. It has a beautiful view of the ocean. I stay there for too long.

### 1800
I shower and scooter back to Reykjavik. I'm vibe-navigating back. I get lost. I'm suddenly at the beach next to the airport.

### 1900
I make it back to my hotel and get dinner: one Icelandic hot dog. I go to Björk’s bar, have five beers, and talk to no one.

### 2300
I make it back to my hotel and go to sleep.

## Day 2
### 1000
I barely make it to BSI Bus Station for my Golden Circle tour. I eat a tuna sandwich and drink a latte that I got from the station. I'm pleasantly surprised by both.

### 1100
Iceland sits on the divergent boundary of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. We arrive at Almannagjá Gorge. I walk between them.

### 1300
We arrive at a spot with geysers, and I see a couple of them go off. They smell like sulfur. I get out of there and go eat lunch at the truck stop: lamb soup with some bread and butter. I dip the bread in the soup. It's delicious.

### 1500
We make it to the last stop of the tour, Gullfoss Falls. Rainbows form around the waterfall — copious volumes of water falling at such speed create a mist that spans tens or hundreds of meters, which in turn causes refraction and separates light into its constituent colors. My brain releases dopamine in ways I've only ever experienced from the consumption of non-nutritive psychoactive substances.

### 1600
During the tour, I realize that the Icelandic tour guide has a wider English vocabulary than my own as he effortlessly drops words such as “multiplicity.”

### 1730
On the way back, I am once again reminded that I am the youngest tourist in this country by a few decades. I make it back to my hotel and grab my swimsuit. I scooter to the geothermal beach where the locals chill. It's next to the airport.

### 1830
An Icelandic girl sits next to me at the hot tub. She goes to take a dip in the freezing ocean, and I make a plan to talk to her. We will lock eyes, and I will smile when she comes back. She walks back, but she doesn’t look at me. The plan is foiled. She sits next to me again. I leave.

### 2000
After a shower, I eat lobster soup and a fish skewer. Both were decent. It's so expensive here. I go back to my hotel to sleep.

## Day 3
### 0330
I wake up to take the bus to the airport. My flight is at 0730.

### 0515
I make it to the airport with ample time to spare. I have a burger and two beers. They have to check my carry-on bag because Europeans are all fragile little communists.

### 1300
Munich time. I see Air Drake at the airport. My hypothesis is the plane likely doesn’t fit at a private airport.

### 1400
I meet up with the homie. We head to the hostel. I'm slightly worried for my safety.

### 1600
We have beers in the lobby while we wait for our friend who's coming from Eastern Europe. We make an Australian friend. The friend arrives, and we have another beer.

### 1900
We need lederhosen for tomorrow. We go acquire them. They're a hundred euros each and certainly don’t fit in my luggage. They're sick, though.

### 2000
Lederhosen acquired. We eat some bratwurst, beautifully paired with German beer. We go back to the hotel to change into pants.

### 2200
After asking around at reception, we head to a fancy cocktail bar. I drink two Negronis far too fast.

### 2300
We decide to go clubbing. At this point, I'm a big fan of electric scooters. I convince my friends we need to rent some and negotiate by telling one of them he can ride mine. I succeed; we take off. I almost lose control at one point but don’t let him know. Some German kids see us and think it’s funny. One of them gets on my other friend’s scooter.

### 2400
We're denied entry to the club.

### 2430
We go to another club and have one drink. We leave. We meet some people outside who offer us drugs after learning we're Mexican. We politely decline.

## Day 4
### 0630
Opening day of Oktoberfest in Munich. We must rise early.

### 0800
We make it to the line. There are so many people here.

### 0900
Doors open. Everyone storms in. We run to the Hofbräu tent. We're too late — there are no tables available. My friend scopes one out with only a couple of people. They claim their friends are coming. That's not how this works. We sit down. The waitress asks what we want to drink, to which we respond, “We want a beer, please.” To our surprise, they don’t start serving beer until noon.

### 1000
We awkwardly sit next to the people whose table we've partially occupied. We meet another disconnected group: a couple who recently relocated to Fresno, California.

### 1200
The don of the brewery takes the stage. He taps the first barrel of Oktoberfest. The crowd erupts. Beers start flowing. We get our first beer. They're normal-sized — one liter. Everyone’s standing on the tables. The atmosphere is electric. A frat boy stands on a table and chugs his liter.

### 1300
We get another normal-sized beer.

### 1400
We get another normal-sized beer.

### 1500
I still haven’t eaten anything. My friend forces me to eat a bit. That’s a good friend.

### 1600
Homie and I leave and go to the hotel. We take a shower and go out to eat.

### 1800
We order a pizza, beautifully paired with German beer.

### 2100
We go back to the hostel and notice there are people at the bar. We sit down.

### 2300
We make friends and have more beers.

### 0100

## Day 5
### 0800
I awake in a state of confusion.

### 0900
I decide it's time for a change and apologetically get us a hotel room.

### 1200
We go get lunch. I get a delicious schnitzel, beautifully paired with German beer.

### 1400
We check in at the hotel. It's unexpectedly nice.

### 1500
We go up to the saltwater pool and have several laughs. We then go to the sauna, which is extremely hot. I'm feeling very dehydrated at this point, so I chug several cups of water.

### 1700
After a shower, we get in our lederhosen and head to Oktoberfest again.

### 1900
We find a spot to sit outside. Soon, some older ladies are looking for a place to sit. My friend kindly offers them a place at our table. They're from Munich and here with their teenage kids, who are drinking inside. We have pleasant conversation and many laughs. We meet one of their husbands — he’s the CEO of a pharmaceutical company.

### 1930
We get a normal-sized beer.

### 2100
We head inside as it’s more lively. We drink and stand on benches and tables. I topple a bench but proudly land on my feet.

### 2400
We head back to the hotel, stop for food, then stop at a bar. My friend debates whether U2 is actually good with an Irishman. We get an Uber.

### 0100
My friend Uber Eats some food and falls asleep. We’re unable to wake him. We eat his food.

## Day 6
### 1000
We wake up. My friend is extremely confused as to what transpired the night prior. We tell him he ordered food and fell into a slumber from which he would not have awoken had the fire alarm gone off.

### 1200
We go into town and head to a bakery for croissants and coffee. Then go back to the hotel.

### 1300
Friend 1 goes to the airport to catch his flight to Barcelona. We head back to Oktoberfest.

### 1500
We have some good chats as we walk around the fair.

### 1600
We decide it's time for a beer. We walk into a tent and order a normal-sized one.

### 1800
We start heading back to the hotel but decide to get one final beer before we do. We stop at a place that unfortunately only sells half-sized ones. We meet a German guy who makes a particularly dark joke about the Holocaust. We don't get it, and he has to explain it three times, at which point he feels awkward.

### 1900
We realize we’ll miss our flight if we don’t leave right now.

### 2000
We make it to the airport with some time to spare. We get through security and get some schnitzel, beautifully paired with German beer.

### 2400
We arrive in Barcelona and head to the Airbnb.

## Day 7
### 1000
We wake up and head to the Sagrada Família.

### 1100
We look at it from the outside for a while and opt not to go in.

### 1200
We walk to see Casa Batlló and Casa Milà. Both are interesting buildings. Gaudí was probably on drugs. We head to a rooftop bar for a beer. The rooftop has beautiful sights, and you can even see the [illegal W Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Barcelona#:~:text=The%20W%20Barcelona%20Hotel%20was,20%20meters%20from%20the%20sea.).

### 1400
We go to La Boqueria to grab a bite. We have sandwiches, octopus, chistorra, and tapas.

### 1500
We walk down La Barceloneta, and I'm impressed not only by the number of yachts but also by their magnitude. The biggest one belongs to the prime minister of Qatar. I thought everyone in Europe was poor.

### 1600
We grab a half-sized beer at a bar near the beach.

### 1700
We leave the bar and continue walking down the beach. I propose we grab another beer; my friends agree. We're more intentional about our choice of bar this time.

### 1800
As we drink our half-sized beers, we ask the Russian girls sitting next to us if they can take a picture of us.

### 1900
We make friends, and they ask if they can come with us.

### 2100
We go out to dinner, and they order half the menu as well as a shisha. The waiter very graciously hands me the check. Thanks. They leave.

### 2300
We get back to the Airbnb and decide we need to go out. We have some drinks and head to Opium Club.

### 0100
It’s a Tuesday at 1 a.m., and the club is packed. We make many friends. The waiter hands me the check again.

## Day 8
### 1100
I wake up potentially still inebriated, and we decide to go to the beach. I realize I lost my sunglasses last night. My friends are on the verge of vomiting the entire Uber ride.

### 1200
We stop by a nice-looking restaurant. We get food and half-sized beers — paella, croquetas, and other stuff probably. It’s all great. The waitress is visibly confused as she doesn’t know whether to speak to us in Spanish or English.

### 1300
We grab some beers from the corner store and head to the beach. We chill there for a bit. I get in the ocean, which is surprisingly very warm. Once I get out, I realize I didn’t bring a towel.

### 1700
We head to the same bar we were at yesterday next to the illegal W to get some half-sized beers. We stay there a while and then head back home.

### 2100
Once at home, we decide to go out again.

### 2300
We get to the club. We mostly spend time on the dance floor.

### 0200

### 0400
Back home.

## Day 9
### 1200
I’ve just woken up, and it’s time to check out of the Airbnb. There’s no opportunity to shower.

### 1300
My friend’s flight is at 3 and mine’s at 5. We say goodbye and head to the airport.

### 1330
I am once again reminded that Europeans are unfamiliar with the concept of working and have never heard of the word “efficiency.” I'm mostly unable to check in to my flight until my online attempt miraculously succeeds.

### 1400
I head to the lounge and have a few final drinks and laughs.

### 1730
Endure a brutal flight back to the homeland.
