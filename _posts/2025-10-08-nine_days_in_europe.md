## Day 1 — Reykjavík
**0930** — I arrive at Keflavik International Airport after a red-eye with no sleep. It's technically 5:30 a.m. for me, but I'm not tired.  
**1000** — I step out of the airport; the air is cold and fresh. The sun is extremely bright. The airport is far from Reykjavik, so I take a $50 bus into town.  
**1100** — Secondary bus drops me near my hotel. I check in on a large screen. My capsule is nice, modern, and cozy—the cheapest I could find.  
**1200** — Explore the city. Breakfast at a nice café — food mid, coffee better. Tourists skew quadragenarian+. This may have been a mistake.  
**1300** — Scooter to the Sun Voyager, Hallgrímskirkja, and Harpa Concert Hall. Intriguing architecture, powerful wind. I send it down a hill.  
**1400** — With swimsuit and backpack, I scooter to Sky Lagoon (≈40 min). Stop for photos; favorite is a statue of a little boy with a fish.  
**1500** — Shower, then into the warm lagoon. The air/water contrast is great. Poolside bar.  
**1700** — Hit the three-beer lagoon limit. A British girl flirts by “mistaking” me for her friend. Cold plunge → too cold → sauna → too hot → plunge again → sauna with ocean views. I stay too long.  
**1800** — Shower and scooter back by vibes. Get lost; end up at the beach by the airport.  
**1900** — Dinner: one Icelandic hot dog. Björk’s bar, five beers, conversation with no one.  
**2300** — Back to hotel. Sleep.

## Day 2 — Golden Circle
**1000** — Barely make it to BSI Bus Station. Tuna sandwich + latte that both slap.  
**1100** — Almannagjá Gorge: Iceland straddles a divergent boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates; I walk between them.  
**1300** — Geysers go off; sulfur smell is real. Lunch at the truck stop: lamb soup with bread and butter. Elite.  
**1500** — Gullfoss Falls: mist → refraction → rainbows; light splits into its constituent colors. My brain releases dopamine reminiscent of non-nutritive psychoactives.  
**1600** — The guide’s English vocab flex (“multiplicity”) exceeds mine.  
**1730** — Youngest tourist by decades, again. Grab swimsuit and scooter to the geothermal beach by the airport.  
**1830** — Hot tub neighbor (Icelandic) sea-dips. I plan an eye-contact + smile play; she never looks back. Plan foiled. She returns; I leave.  
**2000** — Shower. Lobster soup + fish skewer. Decent and expensive. Sleep.

## Day 3 — To Munich
**0330** — Bus to the airport; flight at 0730.  
**0515** — Burger + two beers. Carry-on gets checked because Europeans are fragile little communists.  
**1300** — Munich time. Spot Air Drake; guess private airports can’t fit it.  
**1400** — Meet the homie; head to the hostel. Mild safety concerns.  
**1600** — Lobby beers while waiting for a friend from Eastern Europe. Befriend an Australian. Friend arrives; another beer.  
**1900** — Acquire lederhosen for tomorrow (€100 each). Don’t fit in luggage. Sick though.  
**2000** — Bratwurst + German beer. Change into pants at the hotel.  
**2200** — Fancy cocktail bar. Two Negronis too fast.  
**2300** — Club plan via scooters (I persuade by offering a tandem ride). Almost wipe out; don’t tell him. German kids find this hilarious; one hops on my friend’s scooter.  
**2400** — Denied entry.  
**2430** — Second club: one drink, then out. Strangers offer drugs after learning we’re Mexican. We decline.

## Day 4 — Oktoberfest (I)
**0630** — Opening day. Early start.  
**0800** — In line. Packed.  
**0900** — Doors open. Sprint to Hofbräu tent—too late. We partially occupy a “reserved” table anyway. Waitress asks our order; beer service starts at noon.  
**1000** — Awkward small talk with our unwilling tablemates; meet a couple recently relocated to Fresno.  
**1200** — Brewery don taps the first barrel. Crowd erupts. One-liter “normal-sized” beers arrive. Tables become standing room. Electric atmosphere. One frat boy chugs his liter.  
**1300** — Another liter.  
**1400** — Another liter.  
**1500** — Still no food; friend forces a few bites into me. Good friend.  
**1600** — Shower + food run.  
**1800** — Pizza + German beer.  
**2100** — Hostel bar scene.  
**2300** — New friends, more beers.  
**0100** — …

## Day 5 — Oktoberfest (II)
**0800** — Wake up confused.  
**0900** — I spring for a hotel. Sorry, hostel.  
**1200** — Schnitzel + German beer. Superb.  
**1400** — Check-in. Surprisingly nice.  
**1500** — Saltwater pool laughs; sauna is scorching. Chug water.  
**1700** — Suited in lederhosen; back to the Wiesn.  
**1900** — Offer seats to locals (moms outside; teens inside). Pleasant chat; meet a pharma-CEO dad.  
**1930** — A normal-sized beer.  
**2100** — Inside for energy. Standing on benches; I topple one but stick the landing.  
**2400** — Food stop, then a bar. Irishman vs. U2 debate. Uber home.  
**0100** — Friend orders Uber Eats and immediately sleeps. We eat his food.

## Day 6 — Oktoberfest (III) → Barcelona
**1000** — We brief our confused friend on last night’s events.  
**1200** — Bakery croissants + coffee; hotel reset.  
**1300** — Friend 1 departs for Barcelona. We do one last Oktoberfest lap.  
**1500** — Good chats on the fairgrounds.  
**1600** — One more liter in a tent.  
**1800** — “Last beer” at a spot that only sells half-liters. A German tells a very dark Holocaust joke; we don’t get it after three explanations; he regrets it.  
**1900** — Sprint to the airport.  
**2000** — Security, then schnitzel + German beer.  
**2400** — Land in Barcelona. Airbnb.

## Day 7 — Barcelona Sights
**1000** — Sagrada Família exterior.  
**1100** — We skip going in.  
**1200** — Casa Batlló + Casa Milà. Gaudí was probably on drugs. Rooftop beer with views (including the [illegal W Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Barcelona#:~:text=The%20W%20Barcelona%20Hotel%20was,20%20meters%20from%20the%20sea.)).  
**1400** — La Boqueria: sandwiches, octopus, chistorra, tapas.  
**1500** — La Barceloneta stroll. Yachts for days; the biggest allegedly belongs to the Qatari PM. So much for “poor Europe.”  
**1600** — Half-sized beach beer.  
**1700** — Another bar, chosen with more intention.  
**1800** — Ask Russian neighbors for a photo.  
**1900** — We befriend them; they tag along.  
**2100** — Dinner + shisha. The check finds me. They bounce.  
**2300** — Drinks, then Opium.  
**0100** — Tuesday 1 a.m.; packed. Table, many friends, check finds me again.

## Day 8 — Beach Day
**1100** — Possibly still inebriated. Lost sunglasses. Friends nearly vomit in the Uber.  
**1200** — Restaurant stop: paella, croquetas, etc., plus half-sized beers. Great. Waitress code-switches Spanish/English.  
**1300** — Corner-store beers → beach. Ocean is surprisingly warm. I forgot a towel.  
**1700** — Return to the “illegal W” bar for more half-sized beers. Head home.  
**2100** — Decide to go out again.  
**2300** — Club + table (unused). Dance floor > table.  
**0200** — …  
**0400** — Home.

## Day 9 — Homeward
**1200** — Checkout clock; no time to shower.  
**1300** — Friend’s flight at 3, mine at 5. Airport time.  
**1330** — Europe vs. “efficiency,” round ∞. Online check-in eventually works.  
**1400** — Lounge: final drinks and laughs.  
**1730** — Brutal flight back to the homeland.
